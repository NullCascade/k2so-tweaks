---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.10.1
Date: 2025-11-20
  Changes:
    - Made expanded matter recipes more resilient to different mod lists.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.10.0
Date: 2025-11-20
  Changes:
    - Added/updated stack size standardization for Dyson Sphere Reworked, Maraxsis, and Muluna.
    - Added matter deconversion recipe for basic gases (oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen). This is intended to make producing things like nitric acid on other planets more viable. All added matter recipes can now be disabled.
    - Age of Production: Added pass to try to ensure that the K2 advanced machines (assembling, furnace, chemical) have access to all the base machine's recipes.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.9.1
Date: 2025-11-14
  Changes:
    - Fixed issue where the "Standardize Stack Size" feature could not be disabled.
    - Matter balance tweaks to try to be better in line with the changes in K2SO v1.5.4. 
    - Code cleanup. Pumpjack unification patch is no longer necessary.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.9.0
Date: 2025-11-13
  Changes:
    - Maraxsis: The advanced chemical plant now uses the same placement allowances/restrictions as the normal chemical plant.
    - Moshine: Added matter conversion to/from neodymium.
    - Muluna: Added matter conversion to/from alumina.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.8.1
Date: 2025-10-03
  Changes:
    - Fix for newer versions of Krastorio 2 Spaced Out.
    - Remove K2's default crushing recipe when Crushing Industries is installed. Showing it is no longer required due to improved compatibility between the two mods.
    - Fixed issue with flared fluids not generating new recipes in cases where no other source of that fluid had a recipe generated by K2SO.
    - Improved stack size standardization a bit more with Cerys, Dea Dia, Metal and Stars, and Vesta.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.8.0
Date: 2025-08-21
  Changes:
    - Improve compatibility between K2SO, Moshine, and Muluna. This primarily impacts silicon mining from Muluna's surface and Muluna recipes that use silicon ore. Instead, they will produce and use K2's silicon.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.7.0
Date: 2025-08-19
  Changes:
    - Nitric Acid is now a common fluid, like oxygen/hydrogen/nitrogen.
    - Added stack size standardization to Moshine.
    - Hid processing unit via alumium recipe, now that Muluna 2.0 provides a way to get rare metals on the planet.
    - Added a new (optional) module to help fix up unintended recycling recipes from various mods. This currently helps fix carbon with Moon and Stars, electronic circuits with Automatic Train Painter, and ice platforms recycling from ice.
  Bugfixes:
    - Fix localization in atmospheric condenser recipes.
    - Fixed error from Muluna 2.0 update.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.6.2
Date: 2025-07-08
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixes compatibility with Maraxsis that disabled certain flare stack burning of common fluids. Standardizes burn rates in K2 flare stacks.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.6.1
Date: 2025-07-07
  Bugfixes:
    - Re-enabled atmosphere collection in machines other than the atmosphere condensator, until I can playtest Maraxsis and figure out how I want that recipe to integrate with K2SO.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.6.0
Date: 2025-07-06
  Changes:
    - Add crafting category compatibility between K2SO and Age of Production's armory.
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed sand/glass names when no other mod is installed that adds these items.
    - Fixed sand/glass stack sizes back to K2 defaults.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.5.0
Date: 2025-07-01
  Changes:
    - Restored default pumpjack behavior, and hid the mineral water pumpjack. In the context of Space Age, it didn't make much sense to be mining sulfuric acid with mineral water pumpjacks. Oil pumpjacks are renamed back to pumpjacks, and can mine basic fluid. Existing mineral pumpjacks will continue to function, but should be replaced. A migration file exists to convert the item form to normal pumpjacks.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.4.0
Date: 2025-06-30
  Features:
    - Standardized gas uses. Oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen are now common versions, compatible with Muluna, Maraxsis, and Paracelsin. Migration file exists to convert existing factories.
    - Maraxsis: Atmosphere collection is now done in the atmospheric condenser.
    - Maraxsis: Salt electrolysis is now done in the K2 electrolysis plant.
    - Muluna: Carbon dioxide harvesting from Vulcanus' atmosphere is now done in the K2 atmospheric condenser.
    - Muluna: Disable Muluna's water electrolysis recipe. Buffed K2's electrolysis plant water seperation recipe to match it. The two were redundant with one another.
  Changes:
    - Switched from K2 sand/glass over to common sand/glass. This has a migration, and should not be a breaking change. All factories/filters/circuitry will automatically use the new version and all items will convert.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.0
Date: 2025-06-29
  Features:
    - New patch: Expanded Alternate Recipes. Currently this adds two new recipes for processing units that do not require rare metals, allowing for their production on Muluna and Moshine. These alternates require aluminum or silicon cells.
    - Allow crushing of imersite in Crushing Industries electric crusher.
  Changes:
    - Fixed oversight of mining entities with a single minable result not giving the right converted sand/glass item. No known mods were affected.
    - General refactor of codebase.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.0
Date: 2025-06-29
  Features:
    - New patch: Sandardization. Fixes incompatibility between K2SO, Crushing Industries, Maraxis, and Moshine. All instances of sand and glass are reconfigured to use K2's version.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.0
Date: 2025-06-28
  Features:
    - New patch: Rebalance Crushing Industry around Krastorio 2's ratios.
    - New patch: Standardize stack sizes for other mods to fit with K2's defaults.
  Changes:
    - Muluna surface conditions now support the K2 advanced tank. For some reason...
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.0
Date: 2025-06-28
  Features:
    - New patch: Fix Lighted Poles to respect K2SO's increased wire reach/supply area.
    - New patch: Fix K2SO's nuclear locomotive not being placeable on Muluna.
