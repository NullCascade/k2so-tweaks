[mod-setting-description]
nulls-k2so-standardize-stack-sizes=Brings K2's stack size philosophy to other mods. This means that most items stack to 200, and most machines stack to 50. No rocket capacity changes are made.
nulls-k2so-crushing-industry-ratios=Changes Crushing Industry to use K2's ore-to-plate ratios, and adds a recipe to enrich crushed ores. This ends up being a nerf before Chemical Science, and a buff post-Vulcanus/Gleba, giving a use for ore enrichment for most of the game with Crushing Industry installed.
