nulls-k2so-crushing-industry-ratios=Crushing Industry: K2-Style Ratios
nulls-k2so-maraxsis-quantum-revert=Maraxsis: Revert Quantum Computer changes.

[mod-setting-description]
nulls-k2so-expanded-alternate-recipes=Adds additional alternate recipes for intermediates, to make Krastorio's changes to these ingredients more viable on modded planets.
nulls-k2so-expanded-matter-recipes=Adds additional matter conversion recipes, primarily to try to help get core K2SO resources on planets where it otherwise wouldn't be viable.
nulls-k2so-modify-recycling-results=Attempts to fix various recycling inconsistencies when playing with other mods.
nulls-k2so-standardize-stack-sizes=Brings K2's stack size philosophy to other mods. This means that most items stack to 200, and most machines stack to 50. No rocket capacity changes are made.
nulls-k2so-crushing-industry-ratios=Changes Crushing Industry to use K2's ore-to-plate ratios, and adds a recipe to enrich crushed ores. This ends up being a nerf before Chemical Science, and a buff post-Vulcanus/Gleba, giving a use for ore enrichment for most of the game with Crushing Industry installed.
nulls-k2so-maraxsis-quantum-revert=Undoes the building requirements and name changes by Maraxsis to the Quantum Computer.
